# A Todo List Application

This react app allows you to create, and update todo lists. All data is saved temporarily in your browser. The experience was built using `create-react-app`.

## Installation

If you have node installed, please run `npm install`. If you do not have node installed, I highly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Demo

The app deploys to Netlify, please check it out here: [Todo App](https://storied-caramel-d5710b.netlify.app/)
