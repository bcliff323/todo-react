# A Todo List Application [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e54d0028-0070-4add-b5bd-3aaafdc75097/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/storied-caramel-d5710b/deploys)

This react app allows you to create, and update todo lists. All data is saved temporarily in your browser. The experience was built using `create-react-app`.

## Installation

If you have node installed, please run `npm install`. If you do not have node installed, I highly recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
